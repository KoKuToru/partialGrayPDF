partialGrayPDF
==============

PHP script for converting some PDF pages to grayscaled.

I did need this for work.
We didn't have any tools to do this job (at windows).

Because I own a virtual root-server (with linux), I wrote this script
to be able to remotely convert PDFs.

This PHP-Script needs gs with pdfwrite and pdftk !
